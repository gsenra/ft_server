# ft_server
This is a student project for 42 SÃ£o Paulo. The objective is to set up a NGINX web server on a docker container.

# Work history:
July 24th 2020 - Initial setup and tests. There's some kind of error on the PHP configuration that we haven't found it. No autoindex yet.

July 25th 2020 - Fixed database setup script, server is working now when an image is created from the Dockerfile.

July 28th 2020 - Autoindex works. Server seems to be running smoothly.
